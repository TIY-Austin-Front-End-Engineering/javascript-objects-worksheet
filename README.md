## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `dist/main.js`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors


## Normal Mode
1. Declare a variable `person1` that is an empty object.
2. Declare a variable `person2` that is an object with the following properties:

	* `firstName` should be "Bob"
	* `lastName` should be "Smith"
	* `addressLine1` should be "3601 South Congress Ave"
	* `addressLine2` should be "Austin, TX 78704"
	* `numPets` should be 2

3. Add a `firstName` property to the `person1` object that has a value of your first name (using dot notataion).
4. Add a `lastName` property to the `person1` object that has a value of your last name (using dot notataion).
5. Add a `addressLine1` property to the `person1` object that has a value of your address (using dot notataion).
6. Add a `addressLine2` property to the `person1` object that has a value of your city, state and zip (using dot notataion).
7. Add a `numPets` property to the `person1` object that has a value of the number of pets you own (using dot notataion).
8. Add a `parents` property to the `person1` object that is an array of strings containing your parents names.
9. Create a variable called `people` that is an empty array.
10. Add the `person1` variable to the `people` array.
11. Add the `person2` variable to the `people` array.
12. Iterate over the `people` array and display the first and last name of each person to the console.
13. Declare a variable `pets` that is an array of objects. Each object in the array should have the following properties (add at least four different pets):

	* `name`
	* `type` (dog, cat, fish, bird, etc.)
	* `age`

14. Iterate over the `pets` array and display the name of each pet that is a dog to the console.
15. Iterate over the `pets` array and display the name and age of each pet that is older than four years to the console.
16. Change the age of the second element (index 1) in the `pets` array to `7`.
